# FLoaPT-Engine

(I actually forgot what this acronym stands for)

A game engine written with basic Java libraries using JavaFX for graphics output. Originally programmed for an APCS Final.

## Running

If `make` is installed:

```sh
make build && make run
```

Otherwise, read `Makefile` and run the equivalent commands manually.
